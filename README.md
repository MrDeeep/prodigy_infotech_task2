## Overview
Hii!! I'm Joydip Ram & this repository contains the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Info Tech. For this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of data science.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes information about passengers aboard the Titanic, encompassing their demographics and survival status. This dataset is widely utilized for educational purposes and serves as an excellent opportunity to explore various data analysis techniques.

## Task Description
The primary objective of this task was to conduct data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to extract insights from the Titanic dataset. The analysis involved:

Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values and removing duplicates to ensure data integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating relationships between key variables to identify patterns and trends.
Analysis Highlights

## Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values in critical columns such as Age and Embarked.
Removed duplicate entries to maintain dataset accuracy.

## Exploratory Analysis:
Analyzed relationships between variables such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival rate.
Identified significant patterns, including:
A higher survival rate among female passengers compared to males.
The impact of passenger class on survival likelihood, with first-class passengers having a higher survival rate.
The relationship between age and survival, revealing that younger passengers had a better chance of survival.

## Conclusion
The data cleaning and exploratory data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset yielded valuable insights into the factors influencing survival rates during the Titanic disaster. This analysis not only enhances our understanding of this historical event but also demonstrates the application of data science techniques in deriving meaningful insights from data.
